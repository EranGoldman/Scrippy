## Scrippy
Scrippy is a Chrome and Firefox browser add-on that stores SQL statements to aid in the testing of websites for code injection vulnerabilities. Think cheat sheets but all you do is right click for them.  

This tool is made for web developers, pen testers and hobbyist security researchers that want to test sites for injection vulnerabilities.

## Download and install
Either go to the market places linked in the images above or download a compressed copy from top of the page. Instructions on how to install it manually can be found here (Still to be done)[Wiki](https://github.com/Lmnoppy/Scrippy/wiki "Scrippy Wiki").

## How to use Scrippy

// To be done, would be better if it was in the wiki

## Current Issues
The current context menu does not allow for Scrippy to be used on the URL bar.

Seems to be a bug when right clicking some input fields, the quick selections and favs do not work. [#22](https://github.com/Lmnoppy/Scrippy/issues/22 "On some input... #22")  

## Help
Although i am slowly building this myself as a learning experience, i'd appreciate help in updating the payload files and would really, really like a new UI however, i just can't do it. Good UI design is just beyond me.

See below for the current road map and feel free to contact me with suggestions.
