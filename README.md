# Scrippy
Scrippy is a Chrome and Firefox browser extension that stores SQL statments (more in the future) to aid in the testing of websites for code injection vulnerbulities. Think cheat sheets but all you do is right click for them.  

Currently the JSON payload files are the only part that is open source and free for everyone to do as they wish with them, this is due to the extension still in development and not ready to be made public. However, you can help by adding payloads to the...well payload files :) 

This tool is made for web developers and pen testers that want to test sites/have legal authorisation to work on for SQL and XSS injections (and what other types of attacks get implemented into this tool). I will not be held responsible (and  for your at all in attacking websites that your not allowed and on top of that if this tool fucks up and attacks sites randomly then again i take no responsibility.
