## Scrippy
Scrippy is a Chrome and Firefox browser add-on that stores SQL statements to aid in the testing of websites for code injection vulnerabilities. Think cheat sheets but all you do is right click for them.  

This tool is made for web developers, pen testers and hobbyist security researchers that want to test sites for injection vulnerabilities. You must have a legal right to do so as not having this right can lead to a criminal conviction. by using this tool you acknowledge that you take sole responsibility for your actions and that there is no warranty with this product either explicit or implied. 

Once in a "stable" state and out of beta Scrippy will fall under the GPLv3 licence for open source programs.

Yes updated payloads coming...one day, promise, feel free to send me some :p

## Current Issues
